fusedFullDB		Fusion of all values and labels (training and test)
fusedTidyData		Fusion of all means and sd by each activity (training and test)
fusedValuesDB		Fusuin of all numeric values (training and test)
labeledtestY		Activities translated in respective strings
labeledTrainY		Activities translated in respective strings

The following variables are the same for the training part as well. Just replace "test"for "áº—rain"
